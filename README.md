#  IT Support Ticket Classification using Vertex AI

This project automates the classification of IT support tickets in a university setting using a fine-tuned **Gemini model on Vertex AI**. It takes historical support queries and trains a model to predict categories.

##  Overview

Manual classification of support tickets is slow and inconsistent. This project streamlines that process using:
- Google Cloud's **Vertex AI**
- A fine-tuned **Gemini model**
- Training data formatted in `.jsonl`
- Inference tested via Python in Google Colab
